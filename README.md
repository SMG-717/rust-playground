# Rust Playground

This project serves as a learning point for me to get into Rust, the programming
language. It follows very closely the structure of the 
[book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) written by the developers of Rust but
often deviates in places to explore the capabilities of the language. You might
notice in some chapters I skip ahead and use concepts I've known from other 
programming languages, such as in the Guessing Game.

The Chapters of the book each correspond to a folder with the same name. The 
folders are then split into subfolder each in turn representing a section of 
that chapter. The section numbers do not correspond directly to the ones in the
book, as some sections are merged into one and some others simply have no coding
involved.
